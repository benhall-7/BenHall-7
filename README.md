## Welcome!

I'm a software and full-stack web developer. I love improving systems and creating new ways to painlessly develop code.

I'm intimately experienced with Rust, TypeScript, and React (+ HTML, CSS, & JS), and have formidable experience with other stacks like Python, C#/.NET, Ruby on Rails, and Lua.
